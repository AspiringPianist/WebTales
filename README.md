How to Run

This project uses Streamlit to create a visual novel. To run it, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can check by running python --version in your terminal.

Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install streamlit
# Add any other required libraries here (separated by spaces)


 Use code with caution.

Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired directory. Clone this repository using the following command:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git


 Use code with caution.

Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of your repository.

Run the Project:

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd repository


 Use code with caution.

(Replace repository with the actual name of your folder)

Start the Streamlit app using the following command:

Bash

streamlit run start.py


 Use code with caution.

This will launch the visual novel in your web browser.

Generate and View the Visual Novel:

Follow the instructions in the Streamlit app to generate your visual novel. Once the generation is complete, the app will display a message informing you.

Open the Visual Novel:

Important: After generation, you'll need to manually open the generated index.html file to view the visual novel. This file will typically be located in the same directory as your start.py file.

Open a file explorer and navigate to the project directory (repository in our example). Locate the index.html file and double-click it to open it in your web browser. This will display the generated visual novel.
